## Preamble
I watched the movie "Everything, everwhere all at once" on my plane ride back from San Franciso, US to Singapore. I thought it was a good movie with lots of meaning. Here are my thoughts in point form.

## Always busy
- Evelyn was shown to be always busy all the time managing the laundromat business.
- She was unable to focus on relationships around her.

## Information overload
- The multiverse was a metaphor to how we are always overwhelmed by information in the new information age.
- Concurrently, not all of this information is actual information. They are mixed with misinformation.
- Furthermore, experts are not always able to help us decipher information anymore. We do not have ready access to them. Even when we have access, they might not be correct.
- Individuals are forced to evaluate information on their own.

## Fear of not living the life that you were supposed to live
- Evelyn was shown the possibility of living an alternate life.
- These alternate lives made Evelyn want to escape from her own reality.

## Fear of having difficult conversations around queerness
- Daughter of Evelyn is a lesbian
- Evelyn has difficulty telling father that daughter is a lesbian

## Women and their struggles
- As an independent woman, Evelyn has to run the laundromat.
- As a mother, Evelyn has to take care of her daughter, Joy.
- As a daughter, Evelyn has to take care of her father, Gong Gong.
- As a wife, Evelyn has to take care of her husband, Waymond.

## Thinking about the impossible to make connections with alternate universes
- Absurd requirements to make a verse jump isn't too far fetch with respect to innovation and creativity.
- Often, lateral thinking allows one to think orthogonally and explore uncharted grounds.

## Concluding thoughts
- This movie captured the contemporaneous state of the world, which is deep in confusion under the bombardment of tremendous amount of information. 
- It was also a time when liberalism was on the rise. Feminism, LGBTQIA+ and cultures wars were hot words of strong contention.
- The movie did not give definite solutions to the confusion but offers a potential way to ground ourselves in its ending.
