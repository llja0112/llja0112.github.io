# Hello Everyone!

I am Anthony. Decided to refresh my page again. Would love to post more frequently.

I would love to post content about medicine, software engineering, data science and life.

## Medicine
I am a medical doctor. Medicine is my second love. I would refrain from giving medical opinion through this blog. 2 reasons for doing so: 1) Personalised medical advice is difficult to give without proper medical history taking and physical examination. 2) General medical advice is difficult to give without adequate medical literature review and one generally shouldn't take advice from a blog. :)

Rather, I would love to post my reflections about my medical experiences. I believe this has several benefits: one, it would help promote understanding amongst the general populus about the medical industry. two, it would help me to identify gaps in my practice and grow as a medical professional. three, it could help me to understand systemic problems within my profession and think of solutions to them.

## Engineering
I used to be a software engineer. This is my first love. Posting content related to software engineering helps me to keep current with my software engineering skills. Being incompetent in writing code is one of my greatest fears in life. As much as becoming senile.

## Data science
As a medical professional, medical literature and data drives my medical practice. With the advent of novel predictive modelling methods, learning patterns within medical data would further help to improve the standards of care that I can give to my patients. Blogging about it helps me to improve this area of competency and develop new capabilities.
