“76 days” is the name of the movie depicting events happening in 4 hospitals across Wuhan, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, for 76 days between 23rd January 2020 and 8th April 2020. During the writing of this blogpost, the pandemic had infected 100 million people and taken the lives of 2.2 million people. To the unintroduced, it might be disappointing to find out that this documentary movie reveals nothing about the origins or the chronology of events leading to the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. There have also been many reviews about this movie on the internet. However, few of these reviews are given from a medical perspective. As a medical doctor who had the privilege to work in the frontlines of treating COVID-19 infections at one point of my career, I thought it would be instructive to provide an alternate perspective of the movie.

## On loss without proper farewell

One of the most harrowing scenes of the movie is its introduction. A middle aged lady clad in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) screaming and crying outside the ward of an elderly man who had just passed away. People around her were making a valiant effort to restrain her from rushing forward to embrace the deceased as he was wheeled out of the ward. Constant words of encouragement were given to the lady asking her to stay strong, keep herself together and not to falter. After a few moments, it became clear that the man was none other than the father of the lady. Requests from the lady to see her father and hold his hand fell on deaf ears. Eventually, the body made its way to an ambulance and the scene darkened to form the titles of the movie.

My wife could not believe this scene was real. In her eyes, the scene was dramatised. However, it felt authentic to me. In reality, I have witnessed it before. Let me explain.

In Singapore, even when the number of COVID-19 infections are under control, many patients were unfortunately isolated to rule out COVID-19 infection. Because patients with COVID-19 infections can present with rather nonspecific symptoms, any patient with just the slightest sore throat, cough, runny nose or fever would be isolated and swabbed for COVID-19 virus. My colleagues once joked that, to get swabbed and isolated, one needs to simply just clear his throat in front of the medical doctor.

Such a situation resulted in the unfortunate situation where many sick patients were placed in isolation. If one has terminal cancer and came down with a fever shortly after palliative chemotherapy, you would be in isolation. If one has metastatic lung cancer and has half of the lung fields whited out on chest X-ray, you would be in isolation even when you have no URTI symptoms (reason being no way to exclude you from having concomitant COVID pneumonia). If one has peripheral vascular disease and fever from an infected toe ulcer, one would be isolated. If one is 95 years old and developed urosepsis, one would be isolated. The threshold for isolation is very low and the trouble here is that these patients in the examples I have given above are very ill and their demise is imminent.

When one is isolated, patients’ family cannot simply walk into the ward and accompany patients’ final journeys and last moment. It is often heart wrenching to have to tell families that they cannot visit. Even in the most dire of moments, when family is allowed to the outbreak wards, they cannot enter the isolation rooms. Often, they were made to don the PPEs and watch through the glass windows as their loved ones’ lives slowly ebb away into oblivion. Although most families understand the constraints and are perfectly reasonable about restrictions, the scenes of family waiting outside the isolation room is reminiscent of what happened in the introductory scene of the movie.

## Anarchy during admission

Another concerning scene from the movie is the admission of COVID positive patients from the lift lobby of the Wuhan hospital. Dozens of people attempt to get into the ward by banging on the door leading to the ward and making demands for immediate consultation with the doctor. This is the nightmare of any healthcare professional. Even without the pressures of COVID, public hospitals sometimes suffer from bed crunch with patients lying along corridors and filling up A&E while waiting for bed management units to allocate beds to waiting patients. The worry about such situations is that very sick patients, who do not get beds fast enough, might suffer consequences of delayed treatment (e.g. delayed initiation of antibiotics in sepsis, delayed initiation of IV insulin in diabetic crisis, delayed surgical treatment for appendicitis or intestinal obstruction, etc.). In the case of COVID patients, we are worried about acute onset of respiratory distress. The anxiety of a sick patient dying in the lift is therefore high.

## The tragedy of dementia in isolation

The other tear jerking scene in the movie is the old man with mild COVID infection. This is in fact more common than one might be comfortable with. Allow me to explain. Elderly patients tend to be more susceptible to respiratory tract infections. With community spread of COVID in Singapore, this implies that any one admitted for respiratory tract infections would have to undergo mandatory isolation and COVID swab test. Elderly patients therefore form the majority of patients in isolation wards. In Singapore, 1 in 10 Singaporeans above 60 years old has dementia. Without contact with familiar faces, this exacerbates the condition of these demented elderly. Some refuse to eat. Others throw inconsolable tantrums. Similar to the movie, these elderly patients sometimes wonder about the wards lost. Nurses have to gently guide them back to their beds. With little success on occasion, leading to a referral to the ward doctor for review of what we call Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). Not all patients are suitable for sedatives or medications to control behaviour due to prolonged QT intervals on ECG or other contraindications to medication. The often sad truth is that we sometimes have to leave these elderly wailing uncontrollably in the corridors of the hospital. The additional dimension of the problem is the stress demented patients posed on their family members. With caregiver stress, discharge planning can be a horrible mess to deal with. As seen in the movie, the well elderly patient could not be discharged because family members do not want to pick the patient up from the hospital. This is a common feature of these patients as families seek respite. In the case of the eldery patient in the movie, it is also about fear from the patients of transmitting the virus to the young within the family. It was understood and explained in the movie that the patient had quite a few grandchildren.

## On the newborn who was isolated in Neonatal ICU

Another patient who featured in the film is a pregnant lady who was infected with COVID-19. The film showed her being transported into the operating theatre for a Cesarean section. Under the skilled hands of the surgeon, the baby was delivered. The bad news, however, was that the baby had to be isolated in a neonatal intensive care unit. Although we now know that babies of COVID-19 mothers have passive immunity from maternal antibodies, this was not known during the early stages of the pandemic. Therefore, the medical decision for isolation was a reasonable one to make. We would not know whether the child was born preterm. What we do know from the movie is that the child was isolated for more than a few months. There were scenes of the anxious new parents as they called the hospital again and again only to be told the bad news that their child could not be discharged yet. There were some signs of frustration.

## Possessions of dead and the siren to mark the dead

One of the most touching and powerful scenes is the implicit reference to the dead. Although there were scenes of patients’ clinical status deteriorating, there were no explicit scenes showing their deaths. Instead, what was shown is the process of medical staff sorting out the possessions that the dead left behind. At one point, a nurse had the heartbreaking task of passing these belongings to the family. One of the family members, a daughter to a patient who passed away in ICU griefed on receipt of the belongings, weep uncontrollably.  The nurse tried to comfort her and explained to her that the medical staff did their best and were sorry that they could not keep the patient alive. Slowly, the nurse’s voice cracked and she too was overwhelmed with grief. It is hard to imagine how much emotional burden the Wuhan medical professionals have to carry during the outbreak and lockdown period. Constant stress of sustaining the lives of sick patients and an ever increasing death count takes a toll on mental health. Although there were scenes of healthcare professionals sleeping on waiting chairs along corridors, they were shown as stoic, devoid of fear and steadfast in carrying out their duty. This scene breaks those perceptions and brings out the rawness of human emotion.

## Final thoughts

As I am not a movie critic and I do not have the expertise to rate the specifics / technical details of the movie, I am not going to give a score for this particular movie. However, I would strongly recommend this movie for all people healthcare workers and non healthcare workers included, for several reasons:

#### Reasons for healthcare workers to watch

1. I can understand the concept of not watching a movie that relates to an experience that you already have. As a Singaporean, I served in the military for 2 years as part of national service. When local moviemakers made movies about the Singapore army, I refused to watch any of them. Firstly, I did not wish to relive moments that I do not enjoy. Secondly, I might not be able to tolerate the inaccuracies and misrepresentations. Finally, I would find the reimagined scenes extremely cringeworthy. Therefore, I cannot bring myself to support this sort of movies as it would leave a wrong impression for audience and I cannot live with that. However, these are not reasons not to support a movie like '76 days' because it is not reimagined with a plot inspired from real stories. Instead, this is a documentary movie with real scenes from ground zero of the crisis.
2. I would put it to you that this documentary movie gives a refreshing prespective of the COVID situation, in another country. From the ICU bed arrangement to the setting in which they perform the procedure for ECMO
