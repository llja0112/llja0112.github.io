# Research Review: SARS-CoV2 seropervalence and transmission risk factors among high-risk close contacts

## Brief details of research article
- Origin: Singapore
- Institution: National Center for Infectious Disease
- Study cohort size: 7770 (1863 household contacts, 2319 work contacts, 3588 social contacts) close contacts linked to 1114 PCR-confirmed index cases
- Period of study: 23rd January 2020 to 3rd April 2020
- Study type: Restrospectiove cohort study
- Methods:
  - Epidemiological method: Paticipants are asked to complete a 70 point risk factor questionnaire and a one time blood draw for SARS-CoV2 serology testing.
  - Statistical methodology: To account for potential study subjects that did not consent for SARS-CoV2 PCR swab test, serology test or complete the questionnaire, Bayesian inference was used to fit a model to collected data accounting for PCR testing sensitivities, serological sensitivities, probability of symptoms and participation rate.

## Results of interest
- People who are in close contact with the infected personal
  - Same car
  - Same household
  - Prolonged contact defined as
