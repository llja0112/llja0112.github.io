title: Book review of the book "And The Band Played On"
---

Reading into the history of public health research led me to the discovery of this wonderful book titled "And The Band Played On". It was written by Randy Shilts and published in 1987. A riverting account on the origins of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease Syndrome (AIDS). It detailed the specifics of the AIDS pandemic and how it was handled in the 1980s by the North American and European authorities. Most parts of the book took place in New York and San Francisco, where a huge part of the gay community resided in during the 1980s. There were several learning points from the book that I would like to share here. Interestingly, they are still pertinent more than 4 decades later and many of them could be applied to the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic.


# Lesson #1: Unfortunate naming of AIDS as GRID

In the initial part of the AIDS pandemic, the disease was identified predominantly within the gay community of San Francisco and New York. As a result, it took on the unfortunate name of Gay Related Immune Deficiency (GRID).

This led to the disease being seen as an illness that would only affect gay people. As a result, people outside of the gay community misguidedly believe that the disease would not affect them and refuse to engage in preventive actions to prevent infectious spread.

# Lesson #2: Refusal to believe that AIDS is caused by an unknown virus

Although there were claims that AIDS was caused by an unknown virus, blood banks around US rejected them as that would imply that AIDS can be spread through blood products.  One of the most severely affected community was the hemophiliacs. In the 1980s, one of the communities that donated the most blood was the gay community. Their donated blood products including clotting factors, which was contaminated by the HIV virus, were inadvertently given to hemophiliacs.


- Gay community sees closures of bathhouses as oppression on their gay freedoms
- US community sees lockdowns, social distancing and wearing a mask as contraventions to their fundamental human rights
- In both the AIDS and COVID pandemics, highly educated patients are also misguided by misinformation
- Even medical people refuse to believe in the legitimacy of vaccines and do not wish to have themselves vaccinated

# Funding

One of the biggest problems in the AIDS pandemic was funding. As a result of the sterotype
- Funding was a problem in the AIDS pandemic
- Widespread prejudice and discrimination of the gay community made it difficult for the gay community to garner sufficient
- Funding was not an issue for COVID pandemic

# Research
- The politics and competition within the research Competition to be the "discoverer" of HIV virus was a centerpiece to the problems they face as a community
- Patent claims for the HIV antibody test
- Race to be the first person / institution to develop the treatment for HIV

# Epidemiology / Public health
- Selma Ritz > Contact tracing
- Controversy with regard to closure of the bathhouses in AIDS pandemic
- Circuitbreakers, lockdowns in COVID pandemic
