# On On Reproduction Number (R0) and Singapore's real time R0

## Introduction

From the public health standpoint, an assessment of an infectious disease outbreak is often necessary to determine public policy measures (e.g. social distancing, number of visitors allowed to a home, number of diners allowed to sit together at a dining table, etc.). To perform this assessment, we need robust metrics to determine the spread of disease.

The most common, basic and well understood metric is on the number of new cases of an infectious disease reported daily. Other metrics not commonly discussed are:

1. Reproduction Number (R0)
2. Attack rate
3. Infection rate
4. Serial Interval
5. Transmission risk and rate

This article blog post would like to discuss R0. This metric received significant attention and discussion, after a popular Facebook post by Singapore Prime Ministerâ€™s wife Mdm Ho Ching as linked [here](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1604709026383592&id=100005335308340).

> In addition, we have Covid safe precautions in place among our people, like safe distancing, mask wearing, hand sanitising or cleaning, and crowd management.  This is critical in driving down average secondary transmission from an R0 of 2-3, down to an R0 of about 1. This means instead of infecting on average 2-3 other persons, an infectious C+ index case in Singapore infects about 1 other person. - **Ho Ching**

## On R0

R0 can be defined as the number of secondary infections produced from an actively infective person. There are numerous great videos on YouTube explaining this concept here and here. Wikipedia also has a great explanation of R0 here.

R0 can be calculated in many ways. The basic formula looks deceivingly simple: Average number of infection producing contacts per unit time multiply by the mean infectious time period.

However, there are many difficulties involved in deriving both of these variables necessary for the calculations:
- In the early days of any pandemic, there will be limted data to help us accurately derive both of these variables. This can lead to inappropriate public health measures, espeacially when we underestimate the severity of an outbreak.
- These variables are also affected by public health measures such as movement control, quarantines, lockdowns, social distancing, mandatory orders to wear masks, etc. As more measures are instituted, we can further limit the mean infectious time period of infected individuals thus effectively limiting the spread.
- As interventions/treatments such as vaccines and antivirals appear, the number of infection producing contacts per unit time can be reduced.
- Lastly, the task of producing data to update these numbers are unusually onerous and difficult to undertake. For instance, to calculate just the number of infection producing contacts require (1) Aggressive contact tracing (2) Detailed history taking and physical examination of contacts. Most of the time, this is reduced to questionnaires. (3) Clinical investigation of close contacts. In the context of SARS-CoV2, a nasapharyngeal PCR and blood serological testing would be minimally indicated.

As we are going into phase 3 on the 28th of December 2020, I extracted data between 1st of January 2020 to 20th of December and calculated an estimate of
